<h2>DAY1</h2>

    <h5>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h5>
    <pre>Ans. The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that
     the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison,
     whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.</pre>
    <h5>2.What is the spread operator?</h5>
    <pre>Ans. The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.</pre>

    <h5>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h5>
    <pre>Ans. let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
          Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually denoted by curly braces {}.

     var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
          Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.


     const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
            Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.
    </pre> 
    
    <h5>4.What is execution context</h5>
    <pre>Ans. The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything 
     that aids in its execution. During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser,
     the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.</pre>

    <h5>5.What is meant by first class functions</h5>
    <pre>Ans. A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.
     For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another 
     function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.</pre>

    <h5>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</h5>
    <pre>Ans. A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
     In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.</pre>


    <h5>7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h5>
    <pre> * Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.

 * Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.

 * Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.

  Example:(CALL) 
-----------------
           var person = {  
           name: "James Smith",
           hello: function(thing) {
            console.log(this.name + " says hello " + thing);
          }
       }

       person.hello("world");  // output: "James Smith says hello world"
       person.hello.call({ name: "Jim Smith" }, "world"); // output: "Jim Smith says hello world"

 Example:(APPLY)
 ----------------               
       function personContainer() {
        var person = {  
           name: "James Smith",
           hello: function() {
             console.log(this.name + " says hello " + arguments[1]);
           }
        }
        person.hello.apply(person, arguments);
      }
      personContainer("world", "mars"); // output: "James Smith says hello mars", note: arguments[0] = "world" , arguments[1] = "mars" 
      
 Example:(APPLY)
 ----------------

      var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'};
      var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'};
      
      function say() {
          console.log('Hello ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
      }
      
      var sayHelloJon = say.bind(person1);
      var sayHelloKelly = say.bind(person2);
      
      sayHelloJon(); // Hello Jon Kuperman
      sayHelloKelly(); // Hello Kelly King
